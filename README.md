# zomato_python_project

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Zomatoâ€™s restaurant dataset to uncover insights about restaurant ratings, locations, and service types. Cleaned data by handling nulls, removing duplicates, and transforming inconsistent values. Analyzed rating distribution, location-wise restaurant concentration, and service availability (like online delivery) to identify patterns in customer preferences and business trends. Used visual tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to present findings clearly.
